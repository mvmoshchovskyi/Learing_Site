        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>Manchester City Football Club is an English football club based in Manchester that competes in the Premier
            League, the top flight of English football. Founded in 1880 as St. Mark's (West Gorton), it became Ardwick
            Association Football Club in 1887 and Manchester City in 1894. The club's home ground is the Etihad Stadium
            in east Manchester, to which it moved in 2003, having played at Maine Road since 1923. The club adopted
            their sky blue home shirts in 1894 in the first season of the club's current iteration, and have been used
            ever since.[4]

            Manchester City entered the Football League in 1892, and won their first major honour with the FA Cup in
            1904. The club had its first major period of success in the late 1960s, winning the League, European Cup
            Winners Cup, FA Cup and League Cup under the management of Joe Mercer and Malcolm Allison. After losing the
            1981 FA Cup Final, the club went through a period of decline, culminating in relegation to the third tier of
            English football for the only time in its history in 1998. They since regained promotion to the top tier in
            2001–02 and have remained a fixture in the Premier League since 2002–03.

            In 2008, Manchester City was purchased by Abu Dhabi United Group for £210 million and received considerable
            financial investment in both playing staff and club facilities, including the £150 million Etihad Campus in
            east Manchester.[5] Under the management of Pep Guardiola, the team won the Premier League in 2018, becoming
            the only Premier League team to attain 100 points in a single season. In 2019, they won four trophies,
            completing an unprecedented sweep of all domestic trophies in England and becoming the first English men's
            team to win the domestic treble.[6]

            Manchester City's revenue was the fifth-highest of a football club in the world in the 2018–19 season at
            €568.4 million.[7] In 2019, Forbes estimated the club was the fifth most valuable in the world at $2.69
            billion.[8] The club is owned by the City Football Group, a British-based[9] holding company valued at £3.73
            (US$4.8) billion in November 2019 following a 10% stake sale to Silver Lake.[10]</p>

        <h1>Honours</h1>
        <p>Based on trophy count, Manchester City are one of the most successful teams in England – their twenty-eight
            major domestic and European honours leave them fifth, above Tottenham Hotspur F.C., on the list of most
            decorated sides in England.

            The club's first major trophy was the 1904 FA Cup,[151] though they had previously won three Manchester Cups
            before that point.[152] Their first top division league title came in the 1936–37 season,[11] with the first
            Charity Shield won in the following August.[11] City's first League Cup and European trophy both came at the
            end of the 1969–70 season, the two trophies also constituting the team's first trophy double.[11] In the
            2018–19 season, City became the first team to claim all of the major English trophies available in a single
            season, winning not just the Premier League, FA Cup, and League Cup, but also the Community Shield.[153]

            Their 1970 Cup Winners' Cup victory remains City's only European trophy to date.[154] They also reached the
            final of the Champions League in season 2020-21.

            Manchester City jointly hold the record for most second division titles with Leicester City, both clubs
            having won the league on seven occasions.[155] Their first victory was in 1898–99, and the most recent in
            2001–02.[11]</p>
